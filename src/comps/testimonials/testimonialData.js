      "Val was amazing to work with! Always a constant professional. Val walked us through a home purchase in Twisp and then selling our Winthrop home. She was always very communicative and answered all of our questions. Val was able to sell our home quickly and for a great price. We will definitely use Valerie for all of our future real-estate transactions.",

      "This was my husband's and my first time buying a home in a remote location. Valerie's expertise on properties in Mazama and Winthrop was indispensable. When we finally put an offer on a house, she went above and beyond to help us close the deal. I couldn't be happier with the work she did for us, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend her to anyone looking for a home or property in the Methow Valley.",

      "I cannot say enough positives about Valerie Kardonsky.  My husband and I were looking for property in the Twisp area and Valerie met us on a weekend, fully prepared with numerous properties for us to view.  We fell in love with the one we decided to purchase, and she was communicative, pro-active and a tremendous help with all aspects of the transaction.  We wanted a quick close and she made that happen for our family.  I would highly recommend her for any of your real estate needs.",

      "We were fortunate to be able to have Val represent us when we sold our home in Winthrop, Washington.  She was attentive, responsive and always honest with her feedback.  She kept us in the loop at all times and helped keep our spirits high when we were feeling tense about the process.  If you are looking for someone to help you buy or sell your home in the Methow Valley, Valerie Kardonsky is the right person!",
