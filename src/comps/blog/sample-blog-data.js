    title: "Collaboration Not Competition",
    body: "Before I got into real estate, I managed large scale projects for two major retail companies, directed special events, fund raising events, worked in the service industry and occasionally worked as a stylist at Nordstrom. There’s no way I could have succeeded at any of these jobs without collaboration. No man is an island. There’s no way to produce a successful event, retail store opening or serve someone dinner at a restaurant if you’re not working as a team. The same holds true in real estate. Collaboration continues to be one of my top priorities when it comes to meeting client goals. \n From the moment I list a property, I’m collaborating with the seller, the photographer, the title company, our incredible office manager and sometimes even the neighbors. It takes only one buyer to sell a property but many others to bring it all together and close smoothly. The same is true when I work with buyers. Collaboration starts the moment they share what they’re looking for, their timeline, budget, etc. The collaboration continues as I work with listing agents to show property, seek more property information, present offers and negotiate the deal. Again, it only takes one buyer to buy a property but a team of people to put it all together and close smoothly. \n There’s no place for competition in real estate. If I took that approach, I’d never have a successful sale. The best way I can serve you as a client, whether you’re selling or buying, is though collaboration not competition. Collaboration is the only way to meet and exceed your real estate goals!",

    title: "Just know, wherever you go, you can always go home.",
    body: "While growing up, I swore I would never live in a small town again. Ever. I grew up in Sequim. \n Back then it was still a small town mainly known for the Sequim Irrigation Festival, low rainfall and one certain famous visitor that donated land for the Sequim Bay Marina.\n After I finished college, I moved around a lot. This is an understatement to say the least. You could say I was a nomad, if I had a car. But most of the time I didn’t. I could move on a plane if necessary. It seems I was seeking out some place magnificent, the place of my dreams that I could call home. Anything that wasn’t a small town on the Olympic Peninsula.\n My search took me as far as Amsterdam where I came to love the neighbors that constantly dropped in at dinner time and how everyone looked after each other’s kids. I learned to play cards and other board games while I lived in Chicago. I sought out NW micro brews while I lived in Portland. In San Francisco, I took a deep dive into learning to cook. I was a regular at my favorite North Beach haunts Marios’ Bohemian Cigar Store and Gino & Carlo. I was welcomed into a tight knit community that took care of each other during the big earthquake of 1988. Seattle felt like home every time I returned and I ended up living there the longest. It felt like coming home to be with old college friends and the new ones I met while I worked at Pike Place Market and PONCHO.\n Earlier this summer I took a trip to my childhood home in Sequim. None of us had visited our family home in over 40 years. I spent the day with my sibs, all 6 of them, surrounded by the warmth, laughter and love of being home. On my drive back to Twisp, it occurred to me that my search had ultimately led me to a magnificent place, the place of my dreams that I call home. Turns out, wherever my journey took me and wherever I went, I some how ended up going right back home.",

    body: "Nothing matches the joy of learning to ride a bike when you’re a kid. Suddenly the world is your oyster. You can go anywhere on your bike. Fast forward 55 or so years. I’ve got a different bike, it’s a different time but the world’s still my oyster ‘cause I can ride my bike. \n Bikes were my only means of transportation for many years. I commuted on it when was in college. I rode to my job at The Pink Door with the only visual separating me from kids on their Mormon mission was my bright red lipstick and pixie haircut. These days I have a car and it’s a ton more enjoyable riding my bike for fun! \n My latest bike is a second or third purchase from Methow Cycle Sport and by far my favorite. I love my gravel bike on any of the valley roads and any trail that’s not too technical. One of my favorite rides is from Winthrop up West Chewuch toward Boulder Creek. I stay on the low road and follow the river to the crossing right above Camp 4. It looks really different this year since the 2021 fires but it still fills me with joy and I love the smell of late summer pine air. There are some great rest stops along the way to take in the river views and dream about what I’m going to make for dinner. Ride to eat friends!",
